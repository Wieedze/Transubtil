He was first introduced to electronic music at a young age and quickly developed a connection to the darker and more psychedelic genres. A few years later, he felt the urge to create his own sound to express his ideas and emotions. At just 22 years old, he was already performing his live set at some of the top parties in his country. Balku’s sound is defined by a strong bassline, along with obscure, immersive, and electric sounds that aim to take the listener on an intense journey. He is constantly searching for power and darkness in his music. From his soul to your mind, Balku is André Varandas, Portugal.",
